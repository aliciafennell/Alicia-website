#### Hello reader! 

It's Monday, February 8th, 2021, and my master's group project team is approaching our faculty review presentations. Being in grad school is *busy*, but it's also exciting. Like now&mdash;I'm building my own website on RStudio, something I never would have expected I'd be doing just a few years ago! I hope you can learn a little bit more about me through this website, and please reach out to connect! 


This website was made with Distill--more information below.
