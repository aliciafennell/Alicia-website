In this project, I show the top 50 words used in books 1 and 7, use the AFINN lexicon to perform sentiment analysis on both books, and compare prevalence of gender in book 7. If I had more time, I would have loved to: find and compare the mean AFINN scores for all 7 books; choose a few specific words and graph how often they appear in the texts across the series (for example, “love,” “death,” “magic,” etc.); find the top most positive and most negative chapters across the series (with first guessing which those might be!); and more. I would’ve also loved to add some fun symbols, images, and fonts related to Harry Potter.

California spiny lobsters are an important predator species that can help maintain the health of the kelp forest ecosystem by preying on herbivorous kelp-eating species like sea urchins.\nCalifornia spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus). Photo: californiadiver.comIn January of 2012, two sites in the Santa Barbara Channel, Isla Vista and Naples, were designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPA). This designation regulates and limits human activity in a given area in an effort to conserve biodiversity and improve overall ecosystem health. In this report, findings on lobster size and abundance were compared between sites with MPA status and sites without MPA status. Furthermore, data was compared between 2012 and 2018 in an attempt to see if trends exist in lobster distribution over time. This data is relevant in assessing the effectiveness of MPA designation and how it impacts lobster abundance and size.\nData and Methods\nSanta Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research program at UC Santa Barbara collected data for the abundance, size, and location of California spiny lobsters along the coast of the Santa Barbara Channel from 2012-2018. Spiny lobster abundance and size data was collected during annual dives before the start of the fishing season in late summer at five sites. Divers recorded the number and size of spiny lobsters at four 60 x 5 m (300 m2 total) transects at each site. Two of the sites, Naples and Isla Vista, are Marine Protected Areas that were established in January 2012. Lobster abundance and size distribution for MPA sites and non-protected sites were compared using two-sided two-sample t-tests with a 95% confidence interval and Cohen’s d. All analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1.\n\n\nCode\n\n# Attach packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggridges)\nlibrary(directlabels)\nlibrary(effsize)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n## Read in data and make it tidy\n\nlobster_ab <- read_csv(\"lobster_abundance_sbc_lter.csv\", na = \"-99999\") %>% \n  clean_names()\n\nlobster_tidy <- lobster_ab %>% \n  uncount(count) %>% \n  mutate(site = replace(site, site == \"IVEE\", \"Isla Vista\")) %>%\n  mutate(site = replace(site, site == \"CARP\", \"Carpinteria\")) %>% \n  mutate(site = replace(site, site == \"AQUE\", \"Arroyo Quemado\")) %>% \n  mutate(site = replace(site, site == \"MOHK\", \"Mohawk\")) %>% \n  mutate(site = replace(site, site == \"NAPL\", \"Naples\")) %>% \n  mutate(site_type = if_else(site %in% c(\"Isla Vista\",\"Naples\"), \"MPA\", \"Non-MPA\"))\n\n## Make dataset for Results A to see abundance at differnent sites through the years\n\nannual_ab_site <- lobster_tidy %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  count(site) %>% \n  mutate(site_type = if_else(site %in% c(\"Isla Vista\",\"Naples\"), \"MPA\", \"Non-MPA\"))\n\n ## maybe delete this?

Effects of Marine Protected Area designation on spiny lobster abundance\nThe annual abundance of California spiny lobsters was compared between 2012 and 2018 at five different sites (Figure 1). Two of the five sites were designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPA) at the beginning of 2012 and the counts were annually recorded in late summer at specific transects within these sites.\n\n\nCode\n\n## Results A - visualalization showing  changes in annual lobster abundace at the five sites over time, designating MPA versus non-MPA sites. \ncolor_group <-c(\"cyan4\", \"lightblue3\")\n\n\nggplot(annual_ab_site, aes(x = year, y = n)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = site,\n                color = site_type), \n            size = 0.75) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_group)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    legend.position = c(0.25, .88),\n    legend.justification = c(\"right\", \"top\"),\n    legend.box.just = \"right\",\n    legend.margin = margin(6, 6, 6, 6),\n    legend.background = element_rect(\"white\"))+\n  xlim(2012,2019.5) +\n  geom_dl(aes(label=site,\n              color = site_type),\n          method = \"last.points\") +\n  ggtitle(\"CALIFORNIA SPINY LOBSTER ABUNDANCE (2012 - 2018)\",\n          subtitle = \"Abundance at MPA and non-MPA sites in the Santa Barbara Channel\")+\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Lobster count\",\n       color = \"Site Type\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. California spiny lobster abundance (counts) at transects within Marine Protected Areas (dark teal) and at transects not within Marine Protected Areas (light blue) between 2012 and 2018. Total lobster counts in 2012: MPA(n) = 32, non-MPA(n) = 199. Total lobster counts in 2018: MPA(n) = 1244, non-MPA(n) = 561.\nOverall, the total lobster abundance in MPA sites increased more than non-MPA sites. Total lobster counts within MPA sites increased dramatically from 32 to 1244 between the years 2012 and 2018.Total lobster counts in non-MPA sites also increased from 199 to 561 in that same time period. Of all five sites, abundance of lobsters at Isla Vista (an MPA site) increased the most by 2018.\n2. Lobster size distribution shifts between 2012 and 2018\nIn addition to exploring lobster abundance at different sites over time, size differences in lobsters were observed across different sites and years. Figure 2 explores size distribution shifts from 2012 to 2018 across the five sites.\n\n\nCode\n\n## Data frame for exploring lobster size distribution shifts in 2012 and 2018\n\nlobster_size <- lobster_tidy %>% \n  filter(year == c(2012, 2018)) %>% \n  mutate(site = fct_relevel(site, c(\"Isla Vista\", \"Naples\", \"Arroyo Quemado\", \"Carpinteria\", \"Mohak\")))\n\n## Visualize size distribution \nggplot(lobster_size, aes(x = factor(year), y = size_mm)) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(color = factor(year)), \n              alpha = 0.7)+\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())+\n  facet_grid(~site, switch = \"x\") +\n  labs(title = 'siwtch = \"x\"',\n       x = \"Site\",\n       y = \"Size (mm)\",\n       color = \"Year\")+\n  ggtitle(label = \"CALIFORNIA SPINY LOBSTER SIZE DISTRIBUTION (2012 & 2018)\",\n          subtitle = \"Distribution of size (mm) at all sites\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Size distribution of California spiny lobsters at each site in 2012 compared to 2018. In the box plots, the solid line in the middle represents the median of that sample, while the box itself includes the middle 50% of the data. The whiskers extend to include the remaining 25% of observations on either side of the box, and the solid points indicate outliers. The jitter points behind the boxes are included to show the actual distribution of observed data points. The MPA sites are the first two sites on the graph (Isla Vista and Naples).\nMedians in size between 2012 and 2018 differed more in MPA sites than in non-MPA sites. The median size in MPA sites in 2012 was 64.5 mm, while the median in 2018 was 78 mm. In non-MPA sites, the difference was smaller; the median went from 75 mm in 2012 to 73 mm in 2018. Figure 2 reinforces the findings of Figure 1 by showing the increase in lobster abundance at all sites, most notably in Isla Vista. A small number of outliers in size were observed at all sites except Arroyo Quemado.\n3.

Mean lobster size (mm) was compared and analyzed using two-sided two-sample t-tests for four groupings: MPA and non-MPA sites in 2012, MPA and non-MPA sites in 2018, MPA sites in 2012 and 2018, and non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018.\nTable 1.

This difference in means of 7.54 mm was determined to be significant using a two-sample t-test (t(42.09) = -3.25, p = 0.002) and determining that effect size was medium (Cohen’s d = -0.61).\nIn 2018, mean lobster size again differed based on MPA status. This year, mean lobster size in MPA sites (77.57 \\(\\pm\\) 11.7, n = 1244) was greater than the mean lobster size in non-MPA sites (73.62 \\(\\pm\\) 10.09, n = 561). This difference (3.95 mm) was again statistically significant based on a two-sample t-test (t(1239.51) = 7.31, p < .001) with a medium-small effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.35).\nIn regards to lobster sizes between years, there was a dramatic shift in mean lobster size (mm) at MPA sites (67.38 and 77.57) when compared between 2012 and 2018. This increase in mean size by 10.19 mm was significantly different (t(32.5) = -4.69, p < .001) and effect size was large (Cohen’s d = -0.87).\nIn contrast, mean lobster size (mm) in non-MPA sites remained relatively constant between 2012 and 2018. The difference in mean lobster size was only 1.3 with a small effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.12). The slight decrease (74.92 to 73.62) was not significantly different using a two-sample t-test (t(296.01) = 1.33, p = 0.183).\nSummary\nAbundance of lobsters in both MPA and non-MPA sites increased between 2012 and 2018, with the most dramatic increase observed in Isla Vista. Lobster abundance at MPA sites increased by 3,787.5% between 2012 and 2018, compared to an increase of only 181.9% in non-MPA sites (Figure 1).\nMean lobster size in MPA sites differed significantly between 2012 and 2018. The increase in mean lobster size was 10.19 mm (15.12%) (Table 1).\nBetween 2012 and 2018, mean lobster size in non-MPA sites did not differ significantly. The mean size decreased by 1.3 mm (Table 1).\nBased on these findings, it is possible that Marine Protected Area status has an effect on lobster size and abundance. From 2012 to 2018, lobster size and abundance increased more in Marine Protected Areas than in sites without this designation (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1).\nReferences\nReed D. 2019.

Andrews Experimental Forest have been monitored for over 20 years in an effort to record long-term population trends related to land use. Pacific giant salamanders (genus Dicamptodon) are endemic to the Pacific Northwest and include four distinct species, three of which were differentiated from each other in 1989 (Good, 1989). One of the species, Coastal giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus), was monitored at Mack Creek in Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon from 1993 to 2017. This analysis examines abundance and weights of salamanders for different sections (clear cut and old growth forests) and types of habitat (pools, cascades, and side-channels). Land use and disturbance affect wildlife in different ways, and research is ongoing in these areas to help understand how species will respond to environmental changes. The data analyzed in this report attempts to determine if significant associations exist between salamander abundance, weight, and forest sections in these research zones.\nCalifornia giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) eating a banana slug (Ariolimax californicus).

Andrews Experimental Forest; one of the sites was a section that was clear cut in 1963 and the other site was a 500 year old coniferous forest located further upstream. Researchers collected data annually at the same 150 meter reaches of stream using 2-pass electrofishing.\nMap of the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest and Mack Creek. Photo: Dana Warren.The effects of section type (clear cut or old growth) on the abundance of salamanders in different channel classifications was tested using a Chi-square test. The weights of salamanders found in the two forest sections were compared using two-sided, two sample t-tests with a 95% confidence interval and Cohen’s d. Salamander weights by channel classification were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test and post-hoc Tukey’s HSD. All analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1.\nResults\n1. Annual salamander abundance in clear cut and old growth forest sections\nThe number of coastal giant salamanders in clear cut and old growth forests were recorded each year at Mack Creek between 1993 and 2017 (Figure 1). In both sections of forest, salamander abundance increased during this time period. The number of salamanders found in the clear cut section increased from 126 in 1993 to 368 by 2017 (192% increase). The number of salamanders found in the old growth section increased from 129 to 328 (154% increase). The two sections generally follow the same trends, with similar dips and peaks. Until 2014, most years had higher salamander abundance in old growth forest sections than in clear-cut sections.\n\n\nCode\n\n### Results A\n\n## Results A Data Exploration\n\n# ggplot(salamanders_count, aes(x = year, y = n)) +\n#   geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")+\n#   facet_wrap(~Section)\n\n# ggplot(data = salamanders_count, aes(sample = n))+\n#   geom_qq(aes(color = section),\n#           alpha = 0.5,\n#           show.legend = FALSE)+\n#   facet_wrap(~section)\n\n# ggplot(data = salamanders_count, aes(y = Section, x = year))+\n#   geom_density_ridges(aes(color = Section, \n#                           fill = Section),\n#                       alpha = 0.5)\n\ncolor_group <-c(\"chocolate2\", \"darkgreen\")\n\nggplot(data = salamanders_count, aes(y = n, x = year))+\n  geom_line(aes(color = Section),\n            alpha = 0.5,\n            size = 1.7) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(100, 200, 300, 400)) +\n  ggtitle(\"COASTAL GIANT SALAMANDER ABUNDANCE (1993 - 2017)\",\n          subtitle = \"Annual salamander abundance in clear cut and old growth forest sections\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Salamander count\",\n       color = \"Section\") +\n   theme(\n    legend.position = c(0.25, .88),\n    legend.justification = c(\"right\", \"top\"),\n    legend.box.just = \"right\",\n    legend.margin = margin(6, 6, 6, 6),\n    legend.background = element_rect(\"white\")) +\n   scale_color_manual(values = color_group)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Changes in annual coastal giant salamander abundance (counts) in sections of clear cut forest (orange) and sections of old growth forest (green) from 1993 to 2017. Total salamander counts in 1993: clear cut(n) = 126, old growth(n) = 129. Total salamander counts in 2017: clear cut(n) = 368, old growth(n) = 328.\n2. Abundance of salamander in each section by channel classifications\nBased on the observations recorded in 2017, the proportions of coastal giant salamanders found in different channel classifications (cascade, pool, or side-channel) were calculated within both the clear cut and old growth sections of Mack Creek (Table 1). Notably, the proportions of salamanders found in the different channel classifications were similar across both sections. In both clear cut and old growth forest conditions, the proportion of salamander counts was highest in cascades, lowest in pools, and were almost equal in side-channels, comprising 24% and 23% respectively.\nTable 1. Abundance (counts) and proportions of salamanders found in different channel classifications within clear cut and old growth sections of Mack Creek in 2017. The different channel classifications include cascade, pool, and side-channel.\n\n\nCode\n\n### Results B \n\n## Create a table with wide fromat:\ns_channel_table <- salamanders_channels %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = unittype, values_from = n)\n\n\n## Results  B Create a nice looking table with proportions included\ns_table_props <- s_channel_table %>% \n  adorn_percentages(denominator = \"row\") %>% \n  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0) %>% \n  adorn_ns(position = \"front\") %>% \n  rename(Section = section)\n\ns_table_styled <- kable(s_table_props) %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\",\n                full_width = F,\n                position = \"left\") %>%\n  add_header_above(c(\"Salamander abundance in different channel classifications\" = 4))\n\n\ns_table_styled\n\n\n\n\nSalamander abundance in different channel classifications\n\n\n\nSection\n\n\nCascade\n\n\nPool\n\n\nSide-Channel\n\n\nClear Cut\n\n\n247 (67%)\n\n\n31 (8%)\n\n\n90 (24%)\n\n\nOld Growth\n\n\n201 (63%)\n\n\n45 (14%)\n\n\n74 (23%)\n\n\n3. Effects of forest conditions on salamander locations\nFor both forest conditions, abundance and proportions of salamanders found in each channel classification were compared (Table 1). In pools, a smaller proportion of salamanders were observed in the clear cut section compared to the old growth (8%, n = 31 and 14%, n = 45). Cascades had a similar proportion between the two sections (67%, n = 247 and 63%, n = 201) and side-channels were almost equal (24%, n = 90 and 23%, n = 74). While the abundance of salamanders observed in pools slightly different between the two sections, the overeall proportions were fairly similar across both forest sections. A Pearson’s Chi-square test was used to determine that forest condition does not have an effect on where salamanders are located within the channel (p = 0.063), thus there is no clear association between forest section type and salamander location.\n4. Salamander weights in clear cut and old growth forest sections in 2017\nSalamander weights (grams) were compared between clear cut and old growth forest sections in 2017. The mean weight of salamanders found in clear cut sections was slightly heavier (7.78 g) compared to salamanders found in old growth sections (6.58 g). This difference in mean weights of 1.2 g was found to be insignificant using a two-sample t-test (t(692.79) = 1.67, p = 0.096) with a negligible effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.13). Salamander weights do not differ significantly based on forest condition.\n5. Salamander weights in three channel classifications in 2017\n\n\nCode\n\n### Results E \n\n## Results E Summary Statisitics\n\nsalamanders_summary_type <- salamanders %>%\n  group_by(unittype) %>%\n  filter(unittype %in% c(\"C\", \"P\", \"SC\")) %>% \n  filter(year == \"2017\") %>% \n  summarize(\n    mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),\n    sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),\n    se_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()),\n    var_weight = var(weight, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n## Statistical test \n\n# Exploratory Levene's test to explore variances \n# leveneTest(weight ~ unittype, data = s_weight_type) # P-value is not below 0.05 so we retain the null hypothesis of equal variances\n\n# ANOVA - comparing mean weights between three groups and potential poc-hoc tests depdending on results \n\nweight_ANOVA <- aov(weight ~ unittype, data = s_weight_type)\n\n# weight_ANOVA\n\naov_outputs <- unlist(summary(weight_ANOVA))\n\n# Null hpothesis - the meaens are equal across all three groups.

The only one that differed significantly from each other at %5 significance level is SC-P.\n\n\n\nMean weights for salamanders in 2017 were compared between the three channel classifications, regardless of forest section (clear cut or old growth). Salamanders found in pools had the largest mean weight (9.30 grams), salamanders found in side-channels had the smallest (5.68 grams) and the mean weight of salamanders found in cascades was in between the two (7.52 grams). Using a one-way ANOVA test, it was determined that at least two of the mean weights were significantly different (F(2, 684) = 4.22, p = 0.015). To determine which channel classifications differed in mean weights, a post-hoc Tukey’s HSD test was conducted. The results from this indicated that mean weights differed significantly between side-channels and pools, but there was no significant difference in mean weights between pools and cascades or between side-channels and cascades (p = 0.286 between pools and cascades; p = 0.084 between side-channels and cascades; p = 0.017 between side-channels and pools). Overall, the main difference in mean salamander weights based on channel classification was between side-channels and pools, which was 3.62 grams.\n\n\nCode\n\n## Results E Data Visualization\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_beeswarm(data = s_weight_type,aes(x = unittype, y = weight, color = unittype),\n                size = 1,\n                alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"slategrey\", \"skyblue3\",\"turquoise\"))+\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"Cascades\", \"Pools\", \"Side-channels\"), expand = c(.45,0)) +\n  geom_errorbar(data = salamanders_summary_type, \n                aes(x = unittype, \n                    ymin = 0,\n                    ymax = mean_weight + sd_weight),\n                color = \"darkblue\",\n                width = 0.1) +\n  geom_point(data = salamanders_summary_type, aes(x = unittype, y = mean_weight), \n             color = \"darkblue\",\n             size = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Channel classification\", \n        y = \"Weight (g)\")+\n  ggtitle(\"SALAMANDER WEIGHTS BY CHANNEL CLASSIFICATION (2017)\",\n          subtitle = \"Coastal giant salamander weights between cascades, pools and side-channels\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Coastal giant salamander weights (grams) by channel classification in 2017. The dark blue points in each channel classification indicate the mean weight, and the error bars include one standard deviation on either end of the mean, truncated at zero since salamander weight can not be less than zero.\nIf this analysis were to move forward, it would be advisable to compare other metrics rather than just means between groups. Means are affected by outliers, and, as seen in Figure 2, all groups had a few outliers with high weights. It could be helpful to conduct a rank-based test in addition to comparing means between groups.\nSummary\nSalamander abundance increased in both clear cut and old growth forest sections between 1993 and 2017\nThe location of salamanders in different channel classifications (cascades, pools, and side-channels) in 2017 was not associated with forest condition (clear cut or old growth)\nThe weights of salamanders in both forest conditions were similar in 2017\nThe weights of salamanders found in side-channels and pools were significantly different in 2017\nOverall, in terms of abundance and weights, the salamanders in the research zones were not significantly affected by forest disturbance\nReferences\nHeaston, Emily & Kaylor, Matt & Warren, Dana.

The resulting map shows species richness along the coast, based on how many species are considered present in each pixel.\n\n\nCode\n\n## Attach packages\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(fasterize)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(ggspatial)\n\n## Read in the data stacked \nmy_files <- list.files(path = \"ca_cetaceans\", full.names = TRUE)\ntif_stack <- raster::stack(my_files)\n# tif_stack\n# plot(tif_stack)\n\n### Read in spatial data to show CA \n## check the projection of both layers\nca_counties <- read_sf(\"ca_counties\", layer = \"CA_Counties_TIGER2016\") \n# st_crs(tif_stack)\n# st_crs(ca_counties)\n\n## Different projections - transform to make the same \nca_counties <- st_transform(ca_counties, st_crs(tif_stack))\n\n## Set the threshold for what determines if a species is present \n## Starting with threshold of 0.6 \nthreshold_fun <- function(x, thresh = 0.6) {\n  y <- ifelse(x >= thresh, 1, 0)\n  return(y)\n}\n\nspecies_thresh <- calc(tif_stack, fun = threshold_fun)\n# plot(species_thresh)\n\n## Add rasters together to calculate species richness\nspecies_richness <- calc(species_thresh, fun = sum, na.rm = TRUE)\n# plot(species_richness)\n\n## Make data frame for plotting with ggplot \nspec_rich_df <- rasterToPoints(species_richness) %>% \n  as.data.frame()\n\n## Look at rnaturalearth coastline \n# coastline <- ne_download(scale = 110, type = 'coastline', category = 'physical', returnclass = \"sf\")\n# plot(coastline)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n## Plot species richness \nggplot() +\n  geom_raster(data = spec_rich_df,\n              aes(x = x,\n                  y = y, \n                  fill = layer)) +\n  geom_sf(data = ca_counties, fill = \"white\", color = \"slategray4\") +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-125, -116),\n           ylim = c(32, 38)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Longitude\",\n       y = \"Latitude\",\n       title = \"Cetaceans Species Richness on the California Coast\",\n       fill = \"Number of Species\") +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c(\"white\", \"aliceblue\", \"lightskyblue1\", \"steelblue2\", \"royalblue1\", \"navyblue\"))+\n   annotation_north_arrow(which_north = \"true\",\n                          pad_x = unit(0.5, \"cm\"),\n                          pad_y = unit(0.5, \"cm\"),\n                          style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering,\n                          location = \"tr\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Species richness of Cetacean species along the California coast. Species presence was based on a threshold of 0.6; if the probability of occurrence was 0.6 or above, that species was considered “present.” The darkest spots on this map indicate 28 species present.\n\n\n\n",
