Being in grad school is busy, but it’s also exciting. Like now—I’m building my own website on RStudio, something I never would have expected I’d be doing just a few years ago! I hope you can learn a little bit more about me through this website, and please reach out to connect!\nThis website was made with Distill–more information below.\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web. Learn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",
