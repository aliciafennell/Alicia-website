Iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management specializing in energy and climate and strategic environmental communication. Iâ€™m most interested in food systems, environmental justice, climate action planning, and learning more about our planet and the roles we can play in reducing the damages of climate change.\n            Outside of school, I love cooking, baking, backpacking, writing postcards to friends, and generally not living life on Zoom. I worked for 5 years teaching students in the outdoors, which has given me a deep appreciation for Californiaâ€™s natural lands. Iâ€™m always excited to talk with people about environmental issues, tasty recipes, outdoor education, and good books, so please reach out if you want to connect!\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Alicia Fennell\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              Hello!
