### Two truths and a lie 

 * I've been charged by bison.
 * I've been swimming with orcas. 
 * I've been bitten by a turkey vulture.

#### Wild Geese
By Mary Oliver

*You do not have to be good.*    
*You do not have to walk on your knees*    
*for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.*    
*You only have to let the soft animal of your body*   
*love what it loves.*   
*Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.*  
*Meanwhile the world goes on.*  
*Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain*   
*are moving across the landscapes,*   
*over the prairies and the deep trees,*   
*the mountains and the rivers.*   
*Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,*   
*are heading home again.*   
*Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,*   
*the world offers itself to your imagination,*   
*calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -*   
*over and over announcing your place*   
*in the family of things.*
