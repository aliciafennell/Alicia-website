I'm a master's student, sunshine enthusiast, cookie baker, board game player, and people connector. 

With a background in outdoor and environmental education, I am now pursuing my master's degree in environmental science and management, with a focus on climate and energy. I am especially interested in food systems, environmental justice, climate action planning, and learning more about our changing planet and the roles we can play in reducing the damages. 

Please reach out if you want to connect! I'm always excited to talk with people about environmental issues, yummy recipes, the Pescadero Valley, and good books.
